					<p>A simulation is an approximate imitation of the operation of a process or system;[1] the act of simulating first requires a model is developed. This model is a well-defined description of the simulated subject, and represents its key characteristics, such as its behaviour, functions and abstract or physical properties. The model represents the system itself, whereas the simulation represents its operation over time.People think that we are a simulation.The first theory goes like this: a future civilization might wanted to see how people leaved in the past because of that they made millions of simulations wich they watch.The second theory is that we might be a game and we are controled by players and our inner voices are gamers telling us what to do.

					<p>Even Elon Musk believes in this theory.He believes that there is one in a million of a chance that we are living in a simulation.He said:"40 years ago we had pong,now 40 years later we have photorealistic 3D simulation with millions of people playing,amd its getting better every year.In the future the games will become indistinguishable from reality"

					<p>Scientists think that in approximately a 1000 years the characters in "Sims" will have no idea thay are fake.There is a chance that this entire theoty is false.The only way that would happen is if the civilization ended before we got to that technical advance.But we would probably live for at least 1000 years.Even though we question this subject we cant breack out of it.
